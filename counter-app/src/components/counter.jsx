//------Notes-------//

// the btn within the <div> is bootstrap and adds in some css styling that you can control. Needs more research to underdstand more due to lack of experience and exposure

// "badge badge-primary m-2" <- this is giving zero a blue background or badge and the m-2 is giving it a margin of 2 for space

// badge-primary will create a blue badge
// badge-warning will create a yellow badge

// what is happening in the <ul> is that we are getting a string and mapping it (because it is an array) with jsx expression which then gets compiled into a React element, which is also like a plain JS object

// {this.props.children} is going to set the child attributes that have been given to the counter

// With this Counter component when it comes to the delete button and having 'this.props.onDelete' it is raising an event

// the handleIncrement method is removed because we no longer have state withing the Counter component. The Counter component is going to be a controlled component (expained above)
